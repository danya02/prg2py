# prg2py
Convert `.prg` files to Python code.

`.prg` is a file extension for a particularly nasty variant of the Logo programming language.
The nastiness comes from the fact that, not only are all the commands in Russian, but it can only be run using a closed-source IDE available only on Windows (oh, the horror!).
This is an attempt to provide translation of this language into the crossplatform, free-and-open-source Python.
